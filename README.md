# Star Classification
## Overview
Star classification is a machine learning project aimed at categorizing stars based on their features. This project utilizes astrophysical data to classify stars into different types using supervised learning techniques.

## Features
- Utilizes real-world astronomical datasets.

- Implements machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks.

- Provides data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques for improved classification accuracy.

- Includes visualization tools for better understanding of the dataset.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.8+

- NumPy

- Pandas

- Scikit-learn

- Matplotlib

- Seaborn

### Setup
Clone the repository and install dependencies:

    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/star_classification.git
    cd star_classification
    pip install -r requirements.txt
## Dataset
The project uses an astrophysical dataset containing features such as:

- Magnitude: Brightness of the star.

- Temperature: Surface temperature of the star.

- Luminosity: Total energy emitted by the star.

- Spectral Class: Classification of the star based on its spectrum.

## Usage
### Training the Model
To train the model, run:

    python train.py
### Making Predictions
To classify new data:

    python predict.py --input sample_data.csv
## Results
The project provides an evaluation of different models based on accuracy, precision, and recall. Sample output:

    Model: Naive Bayes
    Accuracy: 85%
    Precision: 83%
    Recall: 86%
